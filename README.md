# matplotlib_challenge
Hello this is my matplot_challenge submission for module_5 homework.
I feel like I am redeeming myself with this assigmment haha.
Anywho let's dive in to what this repositiory now shall we?
# Background
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

# What is in this repository?
In this repository we have a data file that has our study results and mouse data that we will utilize in our work to make summary statitics,all kinds of charts and plots as well as calculations.

The README.md file (the one you are reading right now) is to just give an explanation of what is in this repositiory and the purpose of it.

We have a Jupyter notebook named pymaceuticals_.ipynb that I worked all my code in to get my final results.

pymaceuticals_.ipynb has the follwing :

-Final analysis 

-Dataframes

-Bar charts to show total number of rows of mice for each drug regimen used in the study.

-Pie charts to show the dirtibution of female vs. male mice in the study.

-Quartiles

-Outliers

-Box plots to show distribution of the final tumor volume for all mice in each treatment group.

-Line plot to show one selected mouse treated with a specific drug, utilizing time points vs. recorded tumor volume of that mouse.

-Scatter plot of mouse weight vs. average tumor volume for a whole group of mice based on one drug regimen.

-In that same scatter plot we will calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression
